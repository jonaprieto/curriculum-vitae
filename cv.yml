private-project:
  - name: Poirot, the full-text search engine with extra features
    sponsor: Universidad Sergio Arboleda, IEPRI, COLCIENCIAS
    year: 2014-2016
    description: Poirot is a text search, a package, and analysis platform
      programmed in Mathematica®, designed for retrieval, analysis and
